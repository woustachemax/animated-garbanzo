# Mobile Design Eng?

> This Repo is me trying out animations and eventually getting good at em', basically using a bunch of libraries built for Reac Native and learning, implementing and probably exploring how I could leverage them to be a better Mobile App Developer.

## Animations:

- The first one I'm working on (or if it's in the future, I worked on) is Apple's slide Animation that has taken over 'X' by a storm, to know more about the progress on the same or to just check out how it looks like, I'd recommend you check out [APPLESLIDEANIMATION.md](APPLESLIDEANIMATION.md).
